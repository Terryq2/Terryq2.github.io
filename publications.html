            <br />
            Structural representations in English have been shown to be quite
            abstract, with structural information being represented
            independently from semantic information. Mandarin has a relatively
            sparse marking of syntactic information, with no inflections for
            case, number, or tense. Given this syntactic sparsity, Huang et
            al. (2016) hypothesized that, distinct from English-language
            findings, Mandarin learners may have shared syntactic and semantic
            representations, such that semantic information can guide
            structure building. We examined this question in L2 Mandarin
            learners using a structural priming paradigm that required reading
            Mandarin primes. We found that L2 Mandarin learners exhibit
            within-language structural priming, and this effect is independent
            of semantic information. These findings have two implications: (1)
            this represents the first demonstration of within-language L2
            Mandarin structural priming; (2) L2 learners can develop syntactic
            representations independent of semantic representations, even when
            the target L2 language lacks rich marking of syntactic
            information.

            <br />
            There is a long-standing argument about whether words or character
            morphemes are the functional units in reading Chinese. We propose
            a Character-Word Dual Function (CWDF) model of reading Chinese in
            which both characters and words are functional units that
            contribute differentially to orthographic and meaning processes in
            reading Chinese. Two masked constituent priming experiments
            examined one of the model’s predictions by testing orthographic
            and meaning priming effects in reading Chinese compounds. The
            meaning transparency of the prime (a constituent character) and
            the target (a compound word) was manipulated to distinguish
            meaning effects from orthographic effects. In transparent pairs,
            the prime and target were orthographically and semantically
            related (e.g., 家-家庭 [home-family]); in opaque pairs, the prime
            and target shared orthography only (e.g., 家-家伙 [home-guy]).
            Exposure durations of the prime were varied (50ms and 216ms) to
            allow orthographic and meaning priming, respectively. We
            manipulated word frequency to reflect the accessibility of
            word-level representations. The results are as follows: (1)
            Sharing character level orthography facilitated word reading for
            both high- and low-frequency words, supporting the assumption of
            an important role for the character level in orthographic
            processes. (2) The meaning priming effect was found with the
            longer exposure duration and only for low-frequency words.
            High-frequency words produced rapid access, which was not enhanced
            by the meaning priming of its constituent characters, suggesting
            that the word functions as the primary meaning provider in
            reading. These findings are congruent with the CWDF model, which
            posits that characters are the fundamental orthographic units of
            written Chinese and that words are primary meaning providers.

            <br />
            Although sentence comprehension and production are increasingly
            often studied by combining computational modeling and human
            experiments, this approach remains mostly restricted to studies of
            monolingual or first-language (L1) processing. There are currently
            only very few sentence-level computational models of
            second-language (L2) or bilingual processing (Frank, 2021). This
            lack of computational specifications can hamper further progress
            in bilingualism research. Moreover, better understanding of
            bilingual processing will give more insights into more general
            mechanisms such as cognitive control processes involved while
            switching languages (Luk et al., 2012). Our symposium aims to
            bring together researchers from different labs and with different
            research traditions, working on the intersection of models and
            experiments in bilingual sentence processing. The symposium has
            four talks, by Edith Kaan (associate professor, specializing in
            psycholinguistics of bilingualism), Yung Han Khoe (PhD student,
            working on models of bilingual sentence production), Lin Chen
            (research associate with an expertise in reading processes), and a
            joint talk by Irene Winther (PhD student working on bilingual
            sentence processing) and Yevgen Matusevych (research associate in
            computational cognitive science of language). Finally, we will
            have a panel discussion to suggest how models could be challenged
            by experimental data, and provide new explanatory mechanisms. This
            discussion will be moderated by Xavier Hinaut (research scientist
            in computational neuroscience) and Stefan Frank (associate
            professor in computational psycholinguistics).

            <br />
            Given the morpho-syllabic writing system and the predominance of
            compound words in Chinese, attention to the unit of morpheme or
            character is essential for learning Chinese as a foreign language.
            The usages of characters in word structures vary depending on
            their morphological property (bound vs. free morphemes) and
            semantic ambiguity (polysemous vs. monosemous). This chapter
            investigates the impact of these two variables on learners’ mental
            representation. In the first experiment, 26 learners completed a
            naming task with 116 target characters crossing the two
            independent variables. In the second experiment, a different group
            of 26 learners completed a naming task where the same set of
            characters were prompted by compound words that contain the target
            characters. Results revealed advantages of polysemous and
            free-morpheme characters, but both advantages diminished within
            the word context. Morphemes with distinct semantic representations
            and rich semantic features were processed more easily. Meanwhile,
            the processing of bound morphemes (in comparison to free
            morphemes) was more dependent on the word context. These findings
            provide the psycholinguistic basis for a hybrid pedagogical
            approach where whole-word instruction is complemented by attention
            to individual characters’ sound and meaning in compound words.

            <br />
            When reading in a second language, a reader’s first language may
            be involved. For word reading, the question is how and at what
            level: lexical, pre-lexical, or both. In three experiments, we
            employed an implicit reading task (color judgment) and an explicit
            reading task (word naming) to test whether a Chinese meaning
            equivalent character and its sub-character orthography are
            activated when first language (L1) Chinese speakers read second
            language (L2) English words. Because Chinese and English have
            different spoken and written forms, any cross language effects
            cannot arise from shared written and spoken forms. Importantly,
            the experiments provide a comparison with single language
            experiments within Chinese, which show cross-writing system
            activation when words are presented in alphabetic Pinyin, leading
            to activation of the corresponding character and also its
            sub-character (radical) components. In the present experiments,
            Chinese–English bilinguals first silently read or made a meaning
            judgment on an English word. Immediately following, they judged
            the color of a character (Experiments 1A and 1B) or named it
            (Experiment 2). Four conditions varied the relation between the
            character that is the meaning equivalent of the English word and
            the following character presented for naming or color judgment.
            The experiments provide evidence that the Chinese meaning
            equivalent character is activated during the reading of the L2
            English. In contrast to the within-Chinese results, the activation
            of Chinese characters did not extend to the sub-character level.
            This pattern held for both implicit reading (color judgment) and
            explicit reading (naming) tasks, indicating that for unrelated
            languages with writing systems, L1 activation during L2 reading
            occurs for the specific orthographic L1 form (a single character),
            mediated by meaning. We conclude that differences in writing
            systems do not block cross-language co-activation, but that
            differences in languages limit co-activation to the lexical level.

            Does reading Pinyin, a Roman alphabet transcription of Chinese,
            cause the implicit activation of the corresponding Chinese
            character? To address this question, we carried out two
            experiments with adult Chinese learners, measuring interference in
            character reading in a modified Stroop task. Participants first
            made a meaning judgment on a Pinyin word, and then judged the
            printed color of a character that was either visually related or
            unrelated to the character that corresponded to the Pinyin word. A
            character orthographic interference effect was observed for
            advanced Chinese learners but not intermediate Chinese learners.
            The proficiency-dependent emergence of this interference effect
            suggests its dependence on Chinese character reading experience.
            For models of Chinese reading, the results demonstrate the role of
            the character as a gateway to meaning that, through reading
            experience, comes to be routinely involved in reading for meaning,
            whether the input is a character or an alphabetic spelling.

            How do skilled Chinese readers, accustomed to characters, process
            Pinyin, a phonemic transcription of Chinese? Does the orthography
            of Chinese characters become activated? In four experiments,
            native speakers first made a meaning judgment on a two-syllable
            word written in Pinyin. Immediately following, they responded to a
            character whose orthography sometimes was related to the character
            corresponding to the Pinyin. In Experiments 1 and 3, participant
            named the colour of the presented characters; there was an
            interference effect when the presented characters included
            phonetic radicals that were part of the character corresponding to
            the Pinyin. In Experiments 2 and 4, participants named the
            character; naming times were affected if either the semantic or
            phonetic radical was shared with the character corresponding to
            the Pinyin. The results indicate that access to lexical
            representations in Chinese is centred on the orthographic

            Written word recognition in Chinese links the perception of
            individual characters with whole words. With experience in
            reading, a high-quality word representation can provide top-down
            influence on the perception of its constituent characters, thus
            producing a word superiority effect (WSE). In experiments using
            the Reicher–Wheeler paradigm, we examined the WSE in two-character
            words for native Chinese readers (Experiment 1) and
            low-proficiency adult Chinese learners with Thai (Experiment 2a)
            and Indonesian (Experiment 2b) as native language backgrounds. For
            native Chinese readers, the WSE was smaller for high-frequency
            than low-frequency characters, reflecting rapid access to more
            frequently experienced characters and a consequent reduction of
            top-down word-level effects. Learners of Chinese, however, showed
            a strong WSE for both low-frequency and high-frequency characters,
            reflecting less well-established character representations
            combined with word-level knowledge sufficient to support character
            recognition. The results suggest that native Chinese readers
            develop strong representations at both the character and the word
            level, while low-proficiency Chinese learners are more dependent
            on the word level. We discuss the possibility that a word-level
            emphasis Chinese foreign language instruction is one reason for
            this pattern.

            <br />
            Although writing systems affect reading at the level of word
            identification, one expects writing system to have minimal effects
            on comprehension processes. We tested this assumption by recording
            ERPs while native Chinese speakers read short texts for
            comprehension in the word-to-text integration (WTI) paradigm to
            compare with studies of English using this paradigm. Of interest
            was the ERP on a 2-character word that began the second sentence
            of the text, with the first sentence varied to manipulate
            co-reference with the critical word in the second sentence. A
            paraphrase condition in which the critical word meaning was
            coreferential with a word in the first sentence showed a reduced
            N400 reduction. Consistent with results in English, this N400
            effect suggests immediate integration of a Chinese 2-character
            word with the meaning of the text. Chinese allows an additional
            test of a morpheme effect when one character of a two-character
            word is repeated across the sentence boundary, thus having both
            orthographic and meaning overlap. This shared morpheme condition
            showed no effect during the timeframe when orthographic effects
            are observed (e.g. N200), nor did it show an N400 effect. However,
            character repetition did produce an N400 reduction on parietal
            sites regardless it represented the same morpheme or a different
            one. The results indicate that the WTI integration effect is
            general across writing systems at the meaning level, but that the
            orthographic form nonetheless has an effect, and is specifically
            functional in Chinese reading.

            <br />
            Models of category learning often assume that exemplar features
            are learned in proportion to how much they reduce classification
            error. In contrast, experimental evidence suggests that people
            continue to learn features even when classification is perfect. We
            present three experiments that test explanations for how people
            might learn features in the absence of error. In Experiment 1, we
            varied the type of feedback participants received. In Experiment
            2, we introduced a secondary task during the feedback phase, and
            in Experiment 3, we restricted the response window and varied the
            feedback. In all cases, we found that participants learn many more
            features than they need to classify the exemplars. Our results
            suggest that participants learn the internal correlations between
            features, rather than directly forming associations between
            features and the category label. This finding places restrictions
            on the types of categorisation models that can satisfactorily
            explain learning in the absence of classification error.

            <br />
            Because pronunciation information conveyed by Chinese characters
            is very limited, Pinyin represents a modern phonic transcription
            system of Chinese characters and assists Chinese children and
            foreigners in learning pronunciation of characters. Pinyin
            promotes the connections between the character graphic and
            phonological information. Over the past few years, a growing body
            of research has compared the alphabetic Pinyin and logographic
            characters to investigate whether the word forms affect brain
            processing during reading. However, few studies have directly
            examined whether while reading Pinyin, the corresponding
            orthography of the character becomes activated. The current study
            focused on the activation of character graphic representation
            during Pinyin processing. Four experiments were carried out.
            Experiment 1 and 2 explored the activation of character
            orthography in an automatic Pinyin reading task whereas Experiment
            3 and 4 examined character activation during a Pinyin semantic
            judgment task. Experiment 1 and 2 employed a Stroop-like priming
            task. The Pinyin prime word was presented for 300ms, which was
            subsequently replaced by the target character. The target
            character would stay on the screen for 2000ms or until a color
            decision response was made. Sixty-four characters were chosen as
            targets. Half had similar graphic to prime characters, which were
            presented in Pinyin and the other half did not. In Experiment 3
            and 4, the Pinyin prime word was exposed until participants made a
            semantic judgment response, followed immediately by a target
            character. In contrast to previous three experiments, Experiment 4
            employed a naming task in which participants named the target
            character. The primes and targets were identical to those in
            Experiment 1. The effect of target type was observed only in the
            Pinyin semantic judgment task. The character graphic priming
            effect was inhibitory when the target characters had a similar
            graphic to the prime characters, which were presented in Pinyin,
            suggesting that graphic information was activated during Pinyin
            semantic processing and interfered with the judgment of similar
            target characters. It underscored the potential importance of the
            character graphic information in Pinyin semantic processing. In
            contrast, the inhibitory effect disappeared in the automatic
            Pinyin reading task, indicating that character orthography might
            not be activated during Pinyin automatic processing. These
            findings suggested that the involvement of character graphic
            information in Pinyin processing likely depends on the task
            demands. The activation of the character graphic information
            during Pinyin semantic processing supported the interaction of
            lexical constituents.

            <br />
            Predictive inferences (PI) in text reading can have been defined
            as estimation and expectation to the upcoming matters in the text
            based on the current reading information. Research on PI in text
            reading has been one of the hotspots in the field of narrative
            reading. Numerous researchers have studied on the issues of
            activation, factors, and representation of contextual PI, coming
            up with various achievements. Reality factor and preference factor
            are two main factors influencing the process of readers’ PI, hence
            PI in text reading can be categorized into two different types:
            reality-PI and preference-PI. Reality-PI are PI to the results
            based on the objective situation of contextual information,
            combined with common experience. The readers will predict and
            infer based on their own emotion and preference, i.e.,
            preference-PI. Previous studies on PI mainly focused on the
            processing mechanism of reality-PI, few focus on preference-PI.
            The aim of the present study was to investigate the difference of
            preservation of these two types of PI in long term memory. Three
            experiments were designed, using self-paced reading procedure.
            Experiment 1 and 2 have investigated the preservation of
            reality-PI and preference-PI in long term memory. Experiment 3
            investigated whether preference-PI will vanish by negating the
            reality condition in the sentence which may trigger preference.
            Participants were asked to read short narratives firstly and
            answer a related question after reading each passage. All
            materials were presented on a computer-controlled monitor.
            Participants read the passages in a self-paced manner, advancing
            the text one line at a time by pressing the space bar.
            Participants were instructed to read carefully. The reaction time
            of the prime was recorded and analyzed. The results of the present
            study have suggested that there is obvious difference between the
            preservation of reality-PI and that of preference-PI in the long
            term memory. Preference-PI can be preserved in the long-term
            memory while reality-PI can not. However, readers can no longer
            preserve the original preference-PI if it is restricted by
            real-world condition, which has suggested that preference-PI can
            not solely exist and is restricted by real-world condition. It
            will vanish if negated by the reality and will no longer affect
            readers’ further reading.

            <br />
            One fundamental problem of organized groups is how to distribute
            resources fairly. Fairness and equitable distribution can increase
            working enthusiasm of the organization’s members and make them
            feel worthy to finish their jobs. Previous research found that
            people do not feel allocating money equally is as fair as
            distributing specific goods evenly. Previous studies hold the
            opinion that this kind of result can be attributed to the fact
            that money as a medium of exchange is compared with other specific
            goods rather than other essential properties of money. Based on
            previous studies, another hypothesis put forward that the
            relevance of the allocated resource and salary (the property of
            resource) is another reason for less sense of fairness to
            distribute resources equally. In order to test the possibility,
            three experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 tested the
            possibility that the allocated resource money is more likely to be
            regarded as a part of salary, compared with specific goods.
            Experiment 2 was designed to test whether exchange value resulted
            in less sense of fairness to distribute resources equally when the
            allocated resource is money rather than specific goods. Experiment
            3 examined both factors (the property of resource and medium of
            exchange) which may influence the fairness of distributing
            resource equally. The results of experiment 1 indicated that
            people are more likely to treat extra money as a part of salary
            than extra specific goods. The results of experiment 2 replicated
            the results of previous studies, suggesting that the differences
            in the perceived fairness of allocating different resources lie in
            the medium of exchange of resources. The results of experiment 3
            demonstrated that the property of the resource and the exchange
            value affect the allocated fairness respectively. These three
            experiments of the present study provide support for the
            hypothesis that not only the property but also the relevance of
            the allocated resource and salary have a major impact on this
            important psychological phenomenon, sense of fairness. These
            findings suggest that egalitarian outcomes have a greater
            likelihood of being accepted as unfair, when the resources being
            distributed represent wages rather than welfare. This new
            discovery has important guiding significance for the organization
            to better allocate resources in the future.

            This study examines semantic sense and form-meaning connection
            across the bilingual’s languages as factors behind translation
            priming asymmetry, which refers to semantic priming between
            translation equivalents with L1 (first language) primes and L2
            (second language) targets, but the lack of it in the reverse
            direction. In Experiment 1, many-sense L2 words did prime their L1
            translations having fewer senses in a lexical decision task,
            contradicting the usual lack of L2-to-L1 priming. Results of
            Experiment 2 showed that few-sense L2 items did not prime their
            many-sense translations, but priming occurred in the reverse
            direction. In Experiment 3, only single-sense items were used, and
            priming occurred in the L1-to-L2 but not the L2-to-L1 direction,
            replicating the usual asymmetry. In Experiment 4, priming occurred
            in the L1-few-L2-many direction, indicating that form-meaning
            connection strength plays a role over the semantic sense ratio in
            this situation. Hence, both the relative number of item senses and
            item form-meaning connection strength (L1 > L2 by default, with
            number of senses controlled in Experiment 3) contribute to
            translation priming asymmetry.

            <br />
            Situational model is one of the most intensively investigated
            topics on discourse comprehension. Up to date, it is widely agreed
            that narrative comprehension includes mental representation that
            is based on text description. Event-indexing model explains
            situational model in detail. The former model proposes that events
            are the core units of the mental representation, which are defined
            in five situational dimensions: time, space, character, causality
            and intentionality. Space is an important dimension for
            constructing situational model, and a number of studies have shown
            that readers track spatial information while reading texts. In
            addition, some studies provided evidence supporting that readers
            use spatial shift to segment the consecutive narrative. Radvansky
            and Copeland (2010) explored the influence of spatial shift on the
            processes of situational model updated in narrative reading by
            multi-index detection paradigm, which integrated the previous
            study on spatial situational model updating. However, after
            scrutinizing their experiment, we found that they did not separate
            the factors spatial shift and event shift, which actually are not
            consistent. Based on the above consideration, event segmentation
            and probe words paradigms were adopted to investigate the function
            of event shift and spatial shift in narrative reading by four
            experiments. Experiment 1a repeated a previous study, exploring
            the effect of spatial shift on situational model updating and
            reading time, and further verified the rationality of using
            multi-index detection paradigm in our study. Experiment 1b
            investigated the influence of spatial shift on situational model
            updating under the separation of spatial shift and event shift.
            Experiment 2a studied the effect of spatial shift on event
            segmentation, and further verified the rationality of using event
            segmentation paradigm in our study. Experiment 2b explored the
            influence of spatial shift on event segmentation under the
            separation of spatial shift and event shift, which can verify the
            affect of spatial shift to situational model updating. The results
            showed that the separation of spatial shift and event shift did
            not cause the updating of situational model. Event unit was the
            core unit of constructing the narrative’s mental representation.
            Only when the event shift was identified could spatial shift cause
            readers to update situational model.

            Inference was a tool to establish coherence of the text and
            provided necessary insurance for correct comprehension. The study
            of inference in discourse comprehension using functional magnetic
            resonance imaging (fMRI) was a rather recent, but exciting
            development research area. The existing fMRI researches of
            inference in discourse comprehension nearly all based on
            narrative, studies which based on expository hadn’t been reported
            yet. Now, researchers had a clear consensus that inference was
            coded automatically on-line during narrative reading. Expository
            is another important literary form, inference in expository
            comprehension has been extensively investigated in behavioral
            paradigms, but it was somewhat surprising that there still great
            debated about if local coherence could be coded automatically
            during expository reading or not. And till now, the definitely and
            consistently explanation has not been coincided yet. Meanwhile, it
            was less known about the neural substrates of inference process in
            expository comprehension. In this study, brain activations of
            inference processing in familiar topics expository text
            comprehension were measured using fMRI, which aimed to investigate
            whether readers could drawn inference automatically during
            expository reading and pointed out the core brain area of
            inference processing in expository reading. Meanwhile, Mo had
            pointed out that when there existed reading focus in text, readers
            will make inference around the focus on their own initiative. So
            another aim of this test was to make sure whether focus-based
            reading will influence the inference process of expository
            reading. Participants were asked to read 80 passages which include
            five or six sentences that differed whether or not an inference
            needed to be drawn to understand them. Each sentence was present
            for 3 seconds. Half of the passages were focus-based, and half
            were not. The questions were about the text but not concerned with
            the inference. There whole test was divided into 5 runs and there
            were 16 trials in each run. Participants had to finish a probe
            task after reading each passage. There were two pre-experiments
            which were used to choose test materials and decide reading time
            for each sentence. The MRI signals were obtained when participants
            read the expository texts. The target sentence was the last
            sentence of the passage but not the question sentence. The scanner
            was a 3.0 T Siemens Magnetom Vision MRI scanner. The stimuli were
            presented with black characters on a gray background through the
            projector on the mirror. The functional MRI data from 22
            participants were analyzed with SPM8. The general inference
            related activation appeared in frontal cortex (which included
            inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal
            gyrus), inferior parietal gyrus and precuneus bilaterally in
            expository text reading. These areas were main areas which related
            to the inference process in expository comprehension. In the
            condition of focus-based reading, the cortical related activation
            appeared more concentrate on frontal gyrus bilaterally, especially
            the IFG. The present findings indicated that the basic brain areas
            about inference in expository reading were generally consistent
            with which researchers had found in narrative before. The
            focus-based reading helped readers to pay attention on inference
            processes, other processes which were not concerned with inference
            were restrained. This result supported the bi-processing theory of
            text comprehension.

            <br />
            When categorization is uncertain, the inner mechanism of people’s
            feature induction induced some arguments. In terms of predicting
            features, Rational Model indicated that people would take all
            categories into consideration while single-category theory
            advanced that people only paid attention to the target category.
            The essential difference between Rational Model and
            single-category theory is whether people would take the
            alternative categories into consideration when predicting
            features. But neither Rational Model nor single-category theory
            could explain the results of the research by Verde et al in 2005.
            So Verde et al concluded that the feature prediction in their
            research might be based on feature association. Therefore, three
            experiments were designed in this research to investigate how
            people predicted features when categorization was uncertain.
            Experiment 1 replicated the experiment of Verde et al (2005) in
            Chinese circumstance so that the effect of language would be
            excluded. In Experiment 2, the frequency of the feature
            association in order to find out whether categories were
            considered. Experiment 3 the variable of category was controlled
            in order to find out whether people’s induction was based on
            feature association. Seventy subjects were evenly grouped into
            experiment 1 and experiment 2, and thirty-four subjects in
            experiment 3. All of the subjects were individually tested on
            computers, which controlled list generation, stimulus
            presentation, and response recording. The procedure comprised five
            phases: (1) study, (2) a training test, (3) study, (4) a training
            test, and (5) a final test. During the study phase, all exemplars
            were shown once. Each exemplar was shown for 4000msec. During the
            training test phase, subjects should categorize all exemplars into
            their correct categories. During the final test phase, subjects
            should decide whether or not the to-be-predicted feature was the
            one that most likely to appear with the given feature and then to
            make a yes-no judgment. Experiment 1 gained the same results as
            the experiment conducted by Verde et al (2005). By controlling the
            variable of feature association, Experiment 2 found that there was
            no significant difference in feature prediction between two
            conditions, which indicated that people’s induction was not
            category-based. Via controlling the variable of category,
            Experiment 3 found that there was significant difference in
            feature prediction between two feature association conditions,
            which indicated that people’s induction was based on feature
            association. The three experiments illustrate that people are
            inclined to predict features on the basis of feature association
            when categorization is uncertain. In contrast to the
            category-based prediction, prediction based on feature association
            is an economical strategy, which can be adopted to explain many
            results of the previous studies
