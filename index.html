          The Language, Brain, and Technology Lab at the University of
          Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is an interdisciplinary lab directed by
          Dr. Lin Chen. Our lab aims to understand the cognitive and neural
          mechanisms underlying first and second language processes and their
          roles in knowledge learning. To achieve these goals, we employ a
          variety of methodologies, including behavioral studies,
          eye-tracking, ERPs, co-registration of eye-tracking and EEG, as well
          as generative AI language models, in conjunction with immersive
          technologies.
