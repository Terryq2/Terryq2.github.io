            <p>The Language, Brain, and Technology Lab at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is an
                interdisciplinary lab directed by Dr. Lin Chen. Our lab aims to understand the cognitive and neural
                mechanisms underlying first and second language processes and their roles in knowledge learning. To
                achieve
                these goals, we employ a variety of methodologies, including behavioral studies, eye-tracking, ERPs,
                co-registration of eye-tracking and EEG, as well as generative AI language models, in conjunction with
                immersive technologies.</p>
